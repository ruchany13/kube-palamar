# ⚓️ What is kube-palamar?
`kube-palamar` is a command-line (CLI) tool written in Go that allows you to easily "tie up" (scale down to 0 replicas) and "untie" (scale back up to the original count) your Kubernetes resources like Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets. A web UI is also planned for the future.

The name "Palamar" comes from the Turkish word for a mooring rope used to tie a ship to a dock, symbolizing the act of safely parking your applications to rest.
